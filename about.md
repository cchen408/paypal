## Merchant Services Engineer

I am a software engineer within Merchant Services focused on typhon (nodejs midtier) development. I am proud to have been able to bring our typhon services to the next level.

Currently I manage 4 typhon services. I was the first to get ECI Compliance for a typhon service and also the first to upgrade to Node 6 and then Node 8 moving from callbacks to bluebird coroutines to async await.
